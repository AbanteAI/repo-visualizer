# Repo Visualizer Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines our planned development trajectory for the Repo Visualizer project. As the project evolves, this document will be updated to reflect completed milestones and adjusted priorities.

## Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)

### Repository Analyzer
- [ ] Create basic script to parse local git repositories
- [ ] Extract file structure and metadata (size, path depth)
- [ ] Identify import/reference relationships between files
- [ ] Generate structured JSON output with repository data
- [ ] Add support for parsing git history for time-based visualization

### Visualization Interface
- [ ] Develop basic web interface with canvas for rendering
- [ ] Implement file representation as interactive nodes
- [ ] Establish force-directed graph layout
- [ ] Add node selection to view file contents
- [ ] Implement basic UI controls for visualization parameters

## Phase 2: Enhanced Visualization

### Expanded Analysis
- [ ] Add support for parsing internal file structure (classes, functions)
- [ ] Extract more detailed relationship data (function calls, class inheritance)
- [ ] Implement language-specific parsers for improved code understanding
- [ ] Generate complexity metrics for visualization

### Advanced Visualization
- [ ] Add ability to expand file nodes to show internal components
- [ ] Implement customizable node attributes (size, color based on various metrics)
- [ ] Add timeline scrubber for git history playback
- [ ] Implement zooming levels (repository > directory > file > component)
- [ ] Add search and filtering functionality

## Phase 3: Refinement & Extension

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize rendering for large repositories
- [ ] Implement caching for parsed repository data
- [ ] Add incremental updates for repositories that change

### User Experience
- [ ] Create draggable/dockable configuration panels
- [ ] Add presets for common visualization configurations
- [ ] Implement shareable visualization states
- [ ] Add annotation capabilities

### Extension
- [ ] Create API for custom visualization plugins
- [ ] Develop server component for optional hosted service
- [ ] Add support for visualizing public GitHub repositories directly
- [ ] Implement comparison view for different repository versions or branches

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### Advanced Analysis
- [ ] Integrate semantic code understanding
- [ ] Add automatic identification of code clusters and patterns
- [ ] Implement vector embedding for similarity-based positioning
- [ ] Add commit attribution visualization

### Collaboration Features
- [ ] Add multi-user annotation and sharing
- [ ] Implement visualization embedding for documentation
- [ ] Create export formats for presentations and documentation

### Integration
- [ ] Build IDE plugins for direct access
- [ ] Create integrations with common development platforms
- [ ] Develop CI/CD integration for automated visualization updates

## Future Considerations

- Machine learning for pattern recognition and suggestion
- VR/AR visualization for immersive code exploration
- Real-time collaboration features
- Integration with code review workflows
- Custom visualization templates for different project types
