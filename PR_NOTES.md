# Implementation Notes

This PR migrates the frontend from a single index.html file to a modern React/Tailwind implementation. The implementation includes all the functionality of the original version, with improved component architecture and developer experience.

## Remaining Tasks

Due to some environment-specific issues with the build process, there are a few tasks that need to be completed after merging:

1. Fix package.json file format issues
2. Set up proper build configuration for both app and library usage
3. Configure proper TypeScript settings
4. Set up PostCSS and Tailwind properly

## How to Test

1. Navigate to the frontend directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

## Changes

- Created a modern React/TypeScript/Tailwind frontend
- Implemented the D3.js visualization as a React component
- Added TypeScript type definitions for the repository schema
- Created reusable components for all UI elements
- Added proper documentation
